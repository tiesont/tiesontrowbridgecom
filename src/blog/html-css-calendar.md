I've always liked those little date/calendar icons some blogs have for each of their entries, but I could never figure out how they managed to make the date correct. Then I found this article: _[Creating a Blog Entry Date Calendar Icon Look with CSS, Mostly](http://brainstormsandraves.com/archives/2007/02/22/csscalendar/)_. The author, one _Shirley E. Kaiser, M.A._, wrote a nice article on one possible way of using HTML and CSS to create the appearance of a date "icon."

I thought this idea was pretty neat, and adopted the code she presented for this website. With a little imagination, you can pretty much use this same idea for just about anything.

[Edit:] I redid my site again, and am not using this code anymore, but I still think it's cool.[/Edit]

#### My widget

As I mentioned, I made use of her example to create the calendar "icon." I first hard-coded the month, date, and year to get the proportions how I wanted them. Once I had the CSS in place, it was a simple matter of adding a sprinkle of PHP to the "template" to set the month, date, and year.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="My calendar!" src="/post-assets/calendarcomplete.gif" alt="" /></p>

#### Try it yourself!

If you like this little bit of CSS magic, feel free to use the following code in your own projects. Just take a moment to stop by Ms. Kaiser's web site and say thanks.

##### calendar.css

```css
/*{ Calender Styling } */

.calender {
	float: left;
	width: 50px;
	height: 50px;
	border: solid 1px #404040;
	text-align: center;
	color: #404040;
	background-color: #fff;
	padding: 0;
	margin: 5px;
}

.month, .date, .year { padding: 1px 0; margin: 0; }

.month {
	color: #fffbff;
	text-transform: uppercase;
	font-size: 9px;
	background: #880000 url("images/titlebar-red.png")
	repeat-x;
	border-bottom: solid 1px #404040;
}

.date {
	font-size: 14px;
	font-weight: 600;
	color: #880000;
}

.year { font-size: 8px; padding: 0; }
```

##### calendar.html

```markup
<!-- calendar HTML -->
<div class="calender">
	<p class="month">
	</p>
	<p class="date">
	</p>
	<p class="year">
	</p>
</div>
```

For this sample, I used a PHP function, `getdate`, to have the PHP engine build me an array of the day, month, year, etc. of whenever the page is served. If you are loading a previous entry, say, from a database, you will want to pass a time-stamp into the function. I found this format gave me the best results:

```
Month 00 0000 HH:MM:SS
```

##### calendar.php

```php
<?php
	// getdate() with no arguements will get the current
	// date/time from the system clock.
	// Vist http://us2.php.net/getdate to see the entire date
	// array generated by getdate().
	$date = getdate();
	
	// trim month to three characters.
	// CSS will transform the remaining part of the month
	// into UPPERCASE.
	$month = substr( $date['month'], 0, 3 );
	$day = $date['mday'];
	$year = $date['year'];
?>

<!-- calendar HTML -->
<div class="calender">
	<p class="month">
		<?php echo( $month ); ?>
	</p>
	<p class="date">
		<?php echo( $day ); ?>
	</p>
	<p class="year">
		<?php echo( $year ); ?>
	</p>
</div>
```
