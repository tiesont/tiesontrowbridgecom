I've had a frequent need lately to create various hash-strings (implementing a Gravatar helper, for instance), and I thought some of you might find the utility class I created useful. It's self-contained (other than the obvious reliance on .NET assemblies) and includes an enumeration I created to make the hash-type more obvious to work with.

So, here you go... :)
